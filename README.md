Yet another "Bad Apple!!" on ___ script. This one is a simple copy-and-paste script that goes in the console of the [myedbc](https://myeducation.gov.bc.ca/) calendar.

1. Head to the [website](https://myeducation.gov.bc.ca/) and sign in. Then hit "My Info", "Current Schedule", and zoom out to like 33%.
2. Click any element on the screen that would react to a click (like the "School" dropdown or the "Time" dropdown; "FY" (Full Year) is the best option if you want to set the dropdown in "Time" to that.
3. Hit Ctrl-Shift-I (or Cmd-Shift-I on Mac) to open the console. If that doesn't work, right-click and hit "Inspect".
4. In the window that shows up, hit the "Console" tab. There should be a little text box at the bottom that blinks like a cursor.
5. In there, paste the script in [minified.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flatypus/myedbadapple/master/minified.js) (or the [unminified version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flatypus/myedbadapple/master/unminified.js) if you want to read it).

Enjoy lol!
